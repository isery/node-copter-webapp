###Installation
--------

Some Modules of the Testframework need to be installed globally
```javascript
nvm use v0.8.14
	npm install -g mocha
	npm install -g grunt
	npm install -g connect
	npm install -g node-gyp
```
	
After finishing to install those global modules, in order to get node-canvas
(which we use to decode qr-codes in livestream) to work, you need to have 
http://cairographics.org/download/ installed; for further installation-information
visit their page
http://cairographics.org/download/ - automatic! [Cairographics](http://cairographics.org/download/)


### Troubleshooting
If you have a problem with zombie and contextify, go to 
	xxx/node_modules/zombie/node_modules/jsdom
and here type:
	npm install contextify
because there is a dependency issue with zombie and jsdon/contextify
